- how long until next refresh?
- how soon can we get a list of new refresh variables? and how soon can we publish them?
- metadata variables you want ot exclude?
- run query as a normal user, but with early access to new refresh?

- what happens when datasets marked \_historic?

## TODO:

## To discuss (13/09/22):

- when is the refresh 'finalised' (before releasing), and can we get a list of variables early to pre-build the DB? This can be on our staging branch and merged across to the live version once the release is live in the IDI ...
- any more DDs?
- latest variable changes update was more detailed than normal (according to Barry?) - how likely would we be to get a standardised process for this? i.e., a spreadsheet of variable name changes we can read in?
