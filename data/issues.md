I've gone through and made many of the small changes that I'm sure of (YELLOW), or indicated what I'm unsure of (ORANGE). Some rows may need deleting, which I've marked in (RED).

Other things from my earlier list that I _have not_ changed since there's too much variation and it needs to be fixed in the master template:

- some tables have brackets around variable_name, while some don't ("variable_name" vs "[variable_name]")
- Second column is usually "Field name", but in some tables it's "Variable name"
- some tables use "Description", others use "Variable Description", same with "Type", "Size" columns (some tables include "Variable" prefix)
- "Is Nullable ?" vs "Is Nullable?" (inconsistent space); some "Is NULL?"
- "Additional Information" vs "Additional Variable Information"
