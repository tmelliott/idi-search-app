        <h2>About IDI Search</h2>

        <p>
          IDI Search is a web app that uses data from IDI Data Dictionaries
          shared to us by Stats NZ. The data is stored in a database, which can
          then be searched using the web app. The goal of this app is to allow
          researchers to discover what data is available to use in research
          projects.
        </p>

        <p>
          IDI Search has been developed by{" "}

        <h2>Feedback and Collaboration</h2>

        <p>
          This app is still under development, and as such we are looking for
          feedback from (potential) users. This may be letting us know what

        <h2>Planned Features</h2>

        <p>
          The following additional features are planned for future development:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            display links to other names of variables or datasets, so
            researchers can update code for new refreshes
          </li>
          <li>allow for multiple search terms (AND, OR, etc.)</li>
          <li className="text-green-600 italic line-through">
            include variables with missing data dictionaries: these variables
            will not have descriptions and other such information, but will
            otherwise show up where expected (but with limited search capacity)
          </li>
          <li>continue adding more data dictionaries</li>
          <li>
            add facilities for users to register and provide comments on
            agencies/collections/datasets/variables
          </li>
        </ul>
