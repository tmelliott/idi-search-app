## User Guide

### Searching IDI variables

Typing a keyword (s) in the search box will list all agencies, collections, datasets, or variables containing the term in any of the information associated with it.

Click on ‘Data Supply Agencies’, ‘Collections’, ‘Datasets’ or ‘Variables’ if you want to search for keywords within those fields.

Currently, the search only does an 'AND' search by simply separating search terms with spaces. For example, "social housing" will find results that match both "social" and "housing".

### Exploring variables

Click on rows in the table to view structural metadata about each variable, including the schema and table names required for SQL queries. The green dot beside collections, datasets, and variables indicates that metadata describing the data are available in the Search App.

There are some datasets and variables for which metadata are available, but these metadata are not contained in the app. This is partly because we could not match some datasets to their metadata. We are working to fix this, but in the meantime, please get in touch with access2microdata to check.

### Navigating the app

You can also look for information of your interest by manually navigating through the four tables. The titles ‘Data Supply Agencies’, ‘Collections’, ‘Datasets’ and ‘Variables’ are clickable, and by clicking on them, you will first see the top-level information for that table. By further clicking the rows, it will take you to the next level down.

The information is nested in the following way:

- Data Supplier Agencies
  - Collections
    - Datasets
      - Variables

#### Data Supply Agencies

Lists the names of agencies that have supplied the data added to the Integrated Data Infrastructure. By clicking the row that displays the agency name, you can view all the collections of datasets that the specific agency supplies.

#### Collections

Lists the names of collections, which represents datasets that are grouped together under the same set or collection. The collection names are taken directly from the Data Dictionary or are given a sensible name if the Data Dictionary is unavailable. By clicking the collection, you can view all datasets that sit under the collection.

#### Datasets

Lists the datasets that are present in the latest refresh and the IDI_Adhoc database as of the latest extract by Stats NZ.

#### Variables

Lists the variables contained in all the datasets extracted from the IDI.
